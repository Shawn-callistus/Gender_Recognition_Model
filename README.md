## Gender Recognition Model
### This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for real-time gender recognition from facial images captured through a camera. The model is designed to predict whether a person in the camera feed is male or female.

* Capture Camera Feed: Access the camera feed using OpenCV.
* Preprocess Images: Preprocess the camera images to match the input dimensions required by the model.
* Model Prediction: Feed the preprocessed images into the trained model and obtain predictions for gender.
* Display Results: Display the camera feed with gender predictions overlayed in real-time.
## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing labeled facial images of both male and female individuals. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure the model's performance is accurately assessed.
