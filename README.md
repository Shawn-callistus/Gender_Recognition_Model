* Capture Camera Feed: Access the camera feed using appropriate libraries (e.g., OpenCV).
* Preprocess Images: Preprocess the camera images to match the input dimensions required by the model.
* Model Prediction: Feed the preprocessed images into the trained model and obtain predictions for gender.
* Display Results: Display the camera feed with gender predictions overlayed in real-time.
